### Hello, world! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

About me:

An open-minded averagely-dressed human being in search of a peaceful, intentional, and unstressed life, who likes to learn new things, self-improve, read, watch docuseries, do sports, travel, and meet unique people. Two things I cannot live without are chill music and the feeling of not being stuck. One of my idealistic life goals is to witness a world where money (or materialistic bs in general) wouldn't be the primary goal of it all, and exploitation not an everyday human relation. Above all else, I try to be fair and empathetic, and I expect the same from anyone else. In the end, I'm like Newton's 3rd law -- I give what I get.
